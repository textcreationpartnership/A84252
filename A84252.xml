         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:156033:3"/>in conſultation thereupon, they reſolved to propound certain Propoſitions to the Lords at <hi>NOTTINGHAM,</hi> who are now attending his Royall Majeſty, which was to this effect <hi>VIZ.</hi>
               <list>
                  <item>I. That as Collonell <hi>Goring</hi> is reſolved to yeeld up the Town of <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> to the Parliaments Forces, upon condition he may have free liberty to come to the King, therefore their humble deſires are, that they would be pleaſed to yeeld their conſents, that he may not be admitted to come to his Maieſtie.</item>
                  <item>II. That ſeeing he hath proved falſe and trecherous to the King and Parliament, they are reſolved, that whereſoever they light on him, to be his Executioner, and to cut him in pieces.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe Propoſitions were preſented unto the Lords at <hi>Nottingham, Auguſt</hi> 31. by many thouſands of the Cavaleers.</p>
            <p>And upon Saturday laſt, being the 3. day of this inſtant September, the Honourable houſe of Commons received information from <hi>Portſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi> that Collonell <hi>GORING</hi> hath ſent ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall Treaties to the Committee that lyeth
<pb facs="tcp:156033:3"/>at <hi>Suthicke</hi> fiue miles from the Town of <hi>Portſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi> and would gladly yeeld up the Town to the Parliaments Forces, but firſt he is reſolved to know what puniſhment hee ſhall undergoe before that he will reſign up the ſame, and to that end deſired the Lord <hi>WENTWORTH</hi> to go to the Committee at <hi>Suthick,</hi> with theſe Propoſitions.<list>
                  <item>I. That if they would be pleaſed to grant unto him a free pardon for this Crime which he hath committed, by betraying the Truſt confided in him by both houſes of Parliament, he would reſign up the Town.</item>
                  <item>II. That if they would be pleaſed to to doe him that favour, to give him leave to goe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Seas, and to promiſe, that hee ſhou'd be tranſported over with ſafety, he would yeeld up the Ordinance, and all the reſt of the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition. Theſe Propoſitions and Deſires of Colonell <hi>GORING</hi> was propounded to the Committee by the Lord <hi>WENTVVORTH,</hi> but they could not give him an Anſwer of them, till they knew the Houſes pleaſure ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>The ſaid <hi>GORING</hi> doth now endeavour by all poſſible means to make an eſcape out of the Town of <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> and to goe beyond the Seas, but by reaſon of the great vigilancie and care of the Earle of Warwick, it is thought he cannot make an eſcape without the conſent of both Houſes of <hi>Parliament.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:156033:4"/>
            <p> The great ſpleen and malice that the Cavaleers hath took againſt Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell <hi>Goring</hi> can by no wayes be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſed, they having generally Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to be his Executioner, and to cut him in pieces, and to puniſh him with ſuch torments, that never any Chriſtian as yet endured, becauſe hee proved falſe and treacherous on both ſides.</p>
            <p>He is now in a lamentable condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the Souldiers that are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Town are in a great perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ready to be his Executioner.</p>
            <p>He hath alſo ſincs his firſt ſhutting up of the Gates held out very ſtoutly, and hath beaten down many Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warks and Fortifications, which the Parliaments Forces had raiſed, playing with his Ordnance very faſt againſt them, but now he hath almoſt ſpent all his powder and ſhot, ſo that he cannot hold out very long.</p>
            <p>The Parliaments Forces hath now finiſhed their <hi>Rampeer,</hi> and are reſolved
<pb facs="tcp:156033:4"/>to make an attempt againſt the town very ſuddenly, being in great hopes of gaining the ſame.</p>
            <p>It is thought that the Marqueſſe of <hi>Hartford</hi> is in the like condition that Colonell Goring is in, by reaſon of the abundance of Forces that have now beſieged him in his ſtrong hold at Shereborn Caſtle.</p>
            <p>For upon Saturday laſt, it was ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified to the Houſe of Commons, that the Marqueſſe is compaſſed in with 4. or 5000. men, and that they could eaſily fetch him out but that they are very unwilling to ſhed any bloud, and therefore it may be they will try his patiencr for want of food.</p>
            <p>Likewiſe upon <hi>Satterday</hi> laſt, Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Brown</hi> came from <hi>Kent,</hi> and was brought in by ſeven Companies of Horſe, and came to the Lord Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralls Houſe, and having diſarmed all the Papiſts in the County of <hi>Kent,</hi> brought ſix priſoners with him, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of one was called Maſter <hi>Adrian Scroop</hi>
